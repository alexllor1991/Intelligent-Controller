# Intelligent-Controller
This project implements the intelligent controller logic. It implements a DDS mechanism to exchange network information with other entities. Additionally, it implements a DQN algorithm to deploy VNFs in multi-cluster domains.

The implemented package of a DQN algorithm uses Deep Java Library. It also incorporates the DDS implementation in case of using it without an SDN controller. Thus, it can communicate with other elements through the DDS.<br/>  [rlalgo/src/main/java/com/rlresallo/](rlalgo/src/main/java/com/rlresallo/)

The results of this project have been published in the paper entitled **"DQN-based Intelligent Controller for Multiple Edge Domains"** which has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Network and Computer Applications:

In case of running the **rlalgo package** independent of an SDN controller are necessary some steps:
- Compile the package using the following command: 
  
  mvn clean install -nsu -DskipTests -e
- Export environment variables used by the application:

  export NDDSHOME=/path-to-rti-directory/rti_connext_dds-5.2.3/
  
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path-to-rti-directory/rti_connext_dds-5.2.3/lib/x64Linux3gcc4.8.2/:/path-to-djl-engine-directory/.djl.ai/mxnet/1.9.0-mkl-linux-x86_64/
  
  export RTI_LICENSE_FILE=/path-to-rti-directory/rti_connext_dds-5.2.3/rti_license.dat
  
  export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/
- Execute the application:

  mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.rlresallo.ODLBrain"
