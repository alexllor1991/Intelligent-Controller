# Global_Controller
This repository implements the global controller logic. It implements a DDS mechanism to exchange network information with other controllers. Additionally, it implements a DQN algorithm to deploy SFCs in multiple Kubernetes clusters.

There are two folders: 
- One containing the global controller logic implemented in OpenDaylight distribution through a learning-switch package.
- Another containing the implemented package of a DQN algorithm using Deep Java Library.
